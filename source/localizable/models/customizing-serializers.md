In Ember Data, serializers format the data sent to and received from
the backend store. By default, Ember Data serializes data using the
[JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/) format. If your backend uses a different
format, Ember Data allows you to customize the serializer or use a
different serializer entirely.

Ember Data ships with 3 Serializers. The
[`JSONAPISerializer`](http://emberjs.com/api/data/classes/DS.JSONAPISerializer.html)
is the default serializer and works with JSON API backends. The
[`JSONSerializer`](http://emberjs.com/api/data/classes/DS.JSONSerializer.html)
is a simple serializer for working with single json object or arrays of records. The
[`RESTSerializer`](http://emberjs.com/api/data/classes/DS.RESTSerializer.html)
is a more complex serializer that supports sideloading and was the default
serializer before 2.0.

## JSONAPISerializer Conventions

When requesting a record, the `JSONAPISerializer` expects your server
to return a JSON representation of the record that conforms to the
following conventions.


### JSON API Document

The JSONAPI serializer expects the backend to return a JSON API
Document that follows the JSON API specification and the conventions
of the examples found on [http://jsonapi.org/format](http://jsonapi.org/format/). This means all
type names should be pluralized and attribute and relationship names
should be dash-cased. For example, if you request a record from
`/people/123`, the response should look like this:

```js
{
  "data": {
    "type": "people",
    "id": "123",
    "attributes": {
      "first-name": "Jeff",
      "last-name": "Atwood"
    }
  }
}
```

A response that contains multiple records may have an array in its
`data` property.

```js
{
  "data": [{
    "type": "people",
    "id": "123",
    "attributes": {
      "first-name": "Jeff",
      "last-name": "Atwood"
    }
  }, {
    "type": "people",
    "id": "124",
    "attributes": {
      "first-name": "Yehuda",
      "last-name": "Katz"
    }
  }]
}
```

### Sideloaded Data

Data that is not a part of the primary request but includes linked
relationships should be placed in an array under the `included`
key. For example, if you request `/articles/1` and the backend also
returned any comments associated with that person the response
should look like this:

```js
{
  "data": {
    "type": "articles",
    "id": "1",
    "attributes": {
      "title": "JSON API paints my bikeshed!"
    },
    "links": {
      "self": "http://example.com/articles/1"
    },
    "relationships": {
      "comments": {
        "data": [
          { "type": "comments", "id": "5" },
          { "type": "comments", "id": "12" }
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  "included": [{
    "type": "comments",
    "id": "5",
    "attributes": {
      "body": "First!"
    },
    "links": {
      "self": "http://example.com/comments/5"
    }
  }, {
    "type": "comments",
    "id": "12",
    "attributes": {
      "body": "I like XML better"
    },
    "links": {
      "self": "http://example.com/comments/12"
    }
  }]
}
```

## Customizing Serializers

Ember Data uses the `JSONAPISerializer` by default, but you can
override this default by defining a custom serializer. There are two
ways to define a custom serializer. First, you can define a custom
serializer for your entire application by defining an "application"
serializer.

```app/serializers/application.js
import DS from 'ember-data';

export default DS.JSONAPISerializer.extend({});
```

You can also define a serializer for a specific model. For example, if
you had a `post` model you could also define a `post` serializer:

```app/serializers/post.js
import DS from 'ember-data';

export default DS.JSONAPISerializer.extend({});
```

To change the format of the data that is sent to the backend store, you can use
the [`serialize()`](http://emberjs.com/api/data/classes/DS.JSONAPISerializer.html#method_serialize)
hook. Let's say that we have this JSON API response from Ember Data:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "attributes": {
      "id": "1",
      "name": "My Product",
      "amount": 100,
      "currency": "SEK"
    },
    "type": "product"
  }
}
```

But our server expects data in this format:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "attributes": {
      "id": "1",
      "name": "My Product",
      "cost": {
        "amount": 100,
        "currency": "SEK"
      }
    },
    "type": "product"
  }
}
```

Here's how you can change the data:

```app/serializers/application.js
import DS from 'ember-data';

export default DS.JSONAPISerializer.extend({
  serialize(snapshot, options) {
    var json = this._super(...arguments);

    json.data.attributes.cost = {
      amount: json.data.attributes.amount,
      currency: json.data.attributes.currency
    };

    delete json.data.attributes.amount;
    delete json.data.attributes.currency;

    return json;
  },
});
```

Similarly, if your backend store provides data in a format other than JSON API,
you can use the
[`normalizeResponse()`](http://emberjs.com/api/data/classes/DS.JSONAPISerializer.html#method_normalizeResponse)
hook. Using the same example as above, if the server provides data that looks
like:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "attributes": {
      "id": "1",
      "name": "My Product",
      "cost": {
        "amount": 100,
        "currency": "SEK"
      }
    },
    "type": "product"
  }
}
```

And so we need to change it to look like:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "attributes": {
      "id": "1",
      "name": "My Product",
      "amount": 100,
      "currency": "SEK"
    },
    "type": "product"
  }
}
```

Here's how we could do it:

```app/serializers/application.js
import DS from 'ember-data';

export default DS.JSONAPISerializer.extend({
  normalizeResponse(store, primaryModelClass, payload, id, requestType) {
    payload.data.attributes.amount = payload.data.attributes.cost.amount;
    payload.data.attributes.currency = payload.data.attributes.cost.currency;

    delete payload.data.attributes.cost;

    return this._super(...arguments);
  },
});
```

To normalize only a single model, you can use the
[`normalize()`](http://emberjs.com/api/data/classes/DS.JSONAPISerializer.html#method_normalize)
hook similarly.

For more hooks to customize the serializer with, see the [Ember Data serializer
API documentation](http://emberjs.com/api/data/classes/DS.JSONAPISerializer.html#index).

### IDs

In order to keep track of unique records in the store Ember Data
expects every record to have an `id` property in the payload. Ids
should be unique for every unique record of a specific type. If your
backend used a different key other then `id` you can use the
serializer's `primaryKey` property to correctly transform the id
property to `id` when serializing and deserializing data.

```app/serializers/application.js
export default DS.JSONAPISerializer.extend({
  primaryKey: '_id'
});
```

### Attribute Names

In Ember Data the convention is to camelize attribute names on a
model. For example:

```app/models/person.js
export default DS.Model.extend({
  firstName: DS.attr('string'),
  lastName:  DS.attr('string'),
  isPersonOfTheYear: DS.attr('boolean')
});
```

However, the `JSONAPISerializer` expects attributes to be dasherized
in the document payload returned by your server:

```js
{
  "data": {
    "id": "44",
    "type": "people",
    "attributes": {
      "first-name": "Barack",
      "last-name": "Obama",
      "is-person-of-the-year": true
    }
  }
}
```

If the attributes returned by your server use a different convention
you can use the serializer's
[`keyForAttribute()`](http://emberjs.com/api/data/classes/DS.JSONAPISerializer.html#method_keyForAttribute)
method to convert an attribute name in your model to a key in your JSON
payload. For example, if your backend returned attributes that are
`under_scored` instead of `dash-cased` you could override the `keyForAttribute`
method like this.

```app/serializers/application.js
import Ember from 'ember';
export default DS.JSONAPISerializer.extend({
  keyForAttribute: function(attr) {
    return Ember.String.underscore(attr);
  }
});
```

Irregular keys can be mapped with a custom serializer. The `attrs`
object can be used to declare a simple mapping between property names
on DS.Model records and payload keys in the serialized JSON object
representing the record. An object with the property key can also be
used to designate the attribute's key on the response payload.


If the JSON for `person` has a key of `lastNameOfPerson`, and the
desired attribute name is simply `lastName`, then create a custom
Serializer for the model and override the `attrs` property.

```app/models/person.js
export default DS.Model.extend({
  lastName: DS.attr('string')
});
```

```app/serializers/person.js
export default DS.JSONAPISerializer.extend({
  attrs: {
    lastName: 'lastNameOfPerson'
  }
});
```

### Relationships

References to other records should be done by ID. For example, if you
have a model with a `hasMany` relationship:

```app/models/post.js
export default DS.Model.extend({
  comments: DS.hasMany('comment', { async: true })
});
```

The JSON should encode the relationship as an array of IDs and types:

```js
{
  "data": {
    "type": "posts",
    "id": "1",
    "relationships": {
      "comments": {
        "data": [
          { "type": "comments", "id": "1" },
          { "type": "comments", "id": "2" },
          { "type": "comments", "id": "3" }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`Comments` for a `post` can be loaded by `post.get('comments')`. The
JSON API adapter will send 3 `GET` requests to `/comments/1/`,
`/comments/2/` and `/comments/3/`.

Any `belongsTo` relationships in the JSON representation should be the
dasherized version of the property's name. For example, if you have
a model:

```app/models/comment.js
export default DS.Model.extend({
  originalPost: DS.belongsTo('post')
});
```

The JSON should encode the relationship as an ID to another record:

```js
{
  "data": {
    "type": "comment",
    "id": "1",
    "relationships": {
      "original-post": {
        "data": { "type": "post", "id": "5" },
      }
    }
  }
}
```
If needed these naming conventions can be overwritten by implementing
the
[`keyForRelationship()`](http://emberjs.com/api/data/classes/DS.JSONAPISerializer.html#method_keyForRelationship)
method.

```app/serializers/application.js
export default DS.JSONAPISerializer.extend({
  keyForRelationship: function(key, relationship) {
    return key + 'Ids';
  }
});
```


## Creating Custom Transformations

In some circumstances, the built in attribute types of `string`,
`number`, `boolean`, and `date` may be inadequate. For example, a
server may return a non-standard date format.

Ember Data can have new JSON transforms
registered for use as attributes:

```app/transforms/coordinate-point.js
export default DS.Transform.extend({
  serialize: function(value) {
    return [value.get('x'), value.get('y')];
  },
  deserialize: function(value) {
    return Ember.Object.create({ x: value[0], y: value[1] });
  }
});
```

```app/models/cursor.js
export default DS.Model.extend({
  position: DS.attr('coordinate-point')
});
```

When `coordinatePoint` is received from the API, it is
expected to be an array:

```js
{
  cursor: {
    position: [4,9]
  }
}
```

But once loaded on a model instance, it will behave as an object:

```js
var cursor = store.findRecord('cursor', 1);
cursor.get('position.x'); //=> 4
cursor.get('position.y'); //=> 9
```

If `position` is modified and saved, it will pass through the
`serialize` function in the transform and again be presented as
an array in JSON.

## JSONSerializer

Not all APIs follow the conventions that the `JSONAPISerializer` uses
with a data namespace and sideloaded relationship records. Some
legacy APIs may return a simple JSON payload that is just the requested
resource or an array of serialized records. The `JSONSerializer` is a
serializer that ships with Ember Data that can be used along side the
`RESTAdapter` to serialize these simpler APIs.

To use it in your application you will need to define an
`serializer:application` that extends the `JSONSerializer`.

```app/serializers/application.js
export default DS.JSONSerializer.extend({
  // ...
});
```

For requests that are only expected to return 1 record
(e.g. `store.findRecord('post', 1)`) the `JSONSerializer` expects the response
to be a JSON object that looks similar to this:

```json
{
    "id": "1",
    "title": "Rails is omakase",
    "tag": "rails",
    "comments": ["1", "2"]
}
```

For requests that are only expected to return 0 or more records
(e.g. `store.findAll('post')` or `store.query('post', { filter: { status: 'draft' } })`)
the `JSONSerializer` expects the response to be a JSON array that
looks similar to this:

```json
[{
  "id": "1",
  "title": "Rails is omakase",
  "tag": "rails",
  "comments": ["1", "2"]
}, {
  "id": "2",
  "title": "I'm Running to Reform the W3C's Tag",
  "tag": "w3c",
  "comments": ["3"]
}]
```

The JSONAPISerializer is built on top of the JSONSerializer so they share
many of the same hooks for customizing the behavior of the
serialization process. Be sure to check out the
[API docs](http://emberjs.com/api/data/classes/DS.JSONSerializer.html)
for a full list of methods and properties.


## EmbeddedRecordMixin

Although Ember Data encourages you to sideload your relationships,
sometimes when working with legacy APIs you may discover you need to
deal with JSON that contains relationships embedded inside other
records. The `EmbeddedRecordsMixin` is meant to help with this problem.

To set up embedded records, include the mixin when extending a
serializer then define and configure embedded relationships.

For example if your `post` model contained an embedded `author` record
that looks similar to this:


```json
{
    "id": "1",
    "title": "Rails is omakase",
    "tag": "rails",
    "authors": [
        {
            "id": "2",
            "name": "Steve"
        }
    ]
}
```

You would define your relationship like this:

```app/serializers/post.js
export default DS.JSONSerializer.extend(DS.EmbeddedRecordsMixin, {
  attrs: {
    authors: {
      serialize: 'records',
      deserialize: 'records'
    }
  }
});
```

If you find yourself needing to both serialize and deserialize the
embedded relationship you can use the shorthand option of `{ embedded:
'always' }`. The following example and the one above are equivalent.

```app/serializers/post.js
export default DS.JSONSerializer.extend(DS.EmbeddedRecordsMixin, {
  attrs: {
    authors: { embedded: 'always' }
  }
});
```


The `serialize` and `deserialize` keys support 3 options.
- `records` is used to signal that the entire record is expected
- `ids` is used to signal that only the id of the record is expected
- false is used to signal that the record is not expected

For example you may find that you want to read an embedded record when
extracting a JSON payload but only include the relationship's id when
serializing the record. This is possible by using the `serialize:
'ids'` option. You can also opt out of serializing a relationship by
setting `serialize: false`.

```app/serializers/post.js
export default DS.JSONSerializer.extend(DS.EmbeddedRecordsMixin, {
  attrs: {
    author: {
      serialize: false,
      deserialize: 'records'
    },
    comments: {
      deserialize: 'records',
      serialize: 'ids'
    }
  }
});
```

### EmbeddedRecordsMixin Defaults

If you do not overwrite `attrs` for a specific relationship, the
`EmbeddedRecordsMixin` will behave in the following way:

BelongsTo: `{ serialize: 'id', deserialize: 'id' }`
HasMany:   `{ serialize: false, deserialize: 'ids' }`


There is an option of not embedding JSON in the serialized payload by
using serialize: 'ids'. If you do not want the relationship sent at
all, you can use `serialize: false`.

## Authoring Serializers

If you would like to create a custom serializer its recommend that you
start with the `JSONAPISerializer` or `JSONSerializer` and extend one of
those to match your needs. However, if your payload is extremely
different from one of these serializers you can create your own by
extending the `DS.Serializer` base class. There are 3 methods that
must be implemented on a serializer.

- [normalizeResponse](http://emberjs.com/api/data/classes/DS.Serializer.html#method_normalizeResponse)
- [serialize](http://emberjs.com/api/data/classes/DS.Serializer.html#method_serialize)
- [normalize](http://emberjs.com/api/data/classes/DS.Serializer.html#method_normalize)

Its also important to know about the `normalized` JSON form that Ember
Data expects as an argument to `store.push()`.

`store.push` accepts a JSON API document. However, unlike the
JSONAPISerializer, `store.push` does not do any transformation of the
record's type name or attributes. It is important to make sure that
the type name matches the name of the file where it is defined
exactly. Also attribute and relationship names in the JSON API
document should match the name and casing of the attribute and
relationship properties on the Model.

For Example: given this `post` model.

```app/models/post.js
export default DS.Model.extend({
  title: DS.attr('string'),
  tag: DS.attr('string'),
  comments: hasMany('comment', { async: false }),
  relatedPosts: hasMany('post')
});
```

`store.push` would accept an object that looked like this:

```js
{
  data: {
    id: "1",
    type: 'post',
    attributes: {
      title: "Rails is omakase",
      tag: "rails",
    },
    relationships: {
      comments: {
        data: [{ id: "1", type: 'comment' },
               { id: "2", type: 'comment' }],
      },
      relatedPosts: {
        links: {
          related: "/api/v1/posts/1/related-posts/"
        }
      }
    }
}
```

Every serialized record must follow this format for it to be correctly
converted into an Ember Data record.

Properties that are defined on the model but are omitted in the
normalized JSON API document object will not be updated. Properties
that are included in the normalized JSON API document object but not
defined on the Model will be ignored.

## Community Serializers

If none of the built-in Ember Data Serializers work for your backend,
be sure to check out some of the community maintained Ember Data
Adapters and Serializers. A good place to search for them is [Ember Observer](http://emberobserver.com/categories/data).
