# Troubleshooting

## Bundle command fails to install on OS X El Capitan
`bundle` command fails to install successfully on OS X 10.11 (El Capitan). gem `eventmachine` fails to install.

El Capitan no longer includes Open SSL headers by default. OpenSSL must be install manually (via homebrew or similar).

Solution:

```
brew install openssl
```  

OR

```
brew link openssl --force
```

## Installing on Windows

For Windows developers using [RubyInstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org/), you'll need to [download the DevKit](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads) and install it using instructions:
https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit

After you have a proper install, you can then run:
```sh
gem install bundler wdm tzinfo-data
gem update listen middleman
```

If you get an error like this when doing a gem update (or bundle install):

```sh
Unable to download data from https://rubygems.org/ - SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B: certificate verify failed (https://rubygems.org/latest_specs.4.8.gz)
```

1. Follow the [instructions on this post](https://gist.github.com/luislavena/f064211759ee0f806c88) to install the trust cert.
2. Create an environment variable with a name of ```SSL_CERT_FILE``` (System > Advanced system settings > Environment variables > then "New" under system variables) and set the value to the full path of the cert you [installed in step 1](https://gist.github.com/luislavena/f064211759ee0f806c88). The value should look something like ```C:\Ruby21\lib\ruby\2.1.0\rubygems\ssl_certs\AddTrustExternalCARoot-2048.pem```.
3. Close your shell and re-open, so it loads the new environment variable.
4. Try again
5. If the error still happens, try running ```gem update --system```

After these workarounds, you should finally be able to run `bundle exec middleman`. You may be prompted by Windows Firewall; Click "Allow access" and you'll be in business!
